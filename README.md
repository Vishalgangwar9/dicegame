# dicegame
Your Project :- Gaming track -: Build a dice-rolling game
Your Project's Description :- A group of people initially (invite only) will join in, guess a number from the range
 [1, 6], and then put a bet upon their guess. The one who guesses the output correctly is treated as the
winner(s). Then the entire pool of bets automatically gets distributed across these winner(s).
What problem you are trying to solve
The main
 challenge here is to generate a perfectly random number in the given range (of course on-chain) so as to
 avoid any misleads. Once this is achieved, a complete section of games can be further built upon this
 random module.
 Tech Stack used while building the project :- HTML, CSS ,JAVA SCRIPT
